# agent-adapters Specification

## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Adapter selection
orch SHALL support named agent adapters (`pi`, `claude`, `codex`), selectable per spawn via `--agent <id>` on `orch spawn`, `orch tile`, and `orch queue add`, with the default taken from config (`defaults.adapter`, built-in default `pi`). The chosen adapter SHALL be recorded in the spawn registry so later commands resolve it without re-specification. Agent adapter selection SHALL be independent of the selected plexer backend.

#### Scenario: Spawn a Claude Code fleet
- **WHEN** the user runs `orch spawn 2 --agent claude --tab Team1`
- **THEN** two panes launch the Claude Code CLI (not pi), and `orch status` shows them with `AGENT` = `claude`

#### Scenario: Unknown adapter is rejected
- **WHEN** the user runs `orch spawn 1 --agent aider`
- **THEN** orch exits non-zero with a message listing the supported adapter ids

#### Scenario: Agent selection is backend-independent
- **WHEN** the user runs `orch spawn 1 --backend tmux --agent claude`
- **THEN** orch selects the tmux backend and Claude Code adapter independently, with neither adapter selection nor backend selection requiring a hard-coded branch for the other

### Requirement: Presence protocol as the uniform contract
Every adapter SHALL surface its agent's state through the presence protocol (`$ORCH_DIR/agents/<key>/status.json`, `result.json`, and where supported `inbox.jsonl`, `question.json`/`answer.json`), including a `schema` version and an `agent` field identifying the adapter. Core commands (`status`, `events`, `result`, `wait`, `questions`) SHALL operate on presence data only, never on agent-specific formats. The displayed agent id SHALL come from the presence record or spawn registry, never a hardcoded default. When an agent has no live presence writer, view fallbacks (state, model, cost, task, last text) SHALL be derived from the resolved adapter's own session parsing, gated on that adapter's declared `sessionTail` capability — never from a parser hardcoded to one adapter. The adapter SHALL receive agent identity through an opaque orch-provided environment key and MUST NOT obtain it from a plexer-specific variable.

#### Scenario: Mixed fleet in one status table
- **WHEN** a pi agent and a claude agent are both running and `orch status --json` is invoked
- **THEN** both entries appear with the same fields (state, task, cost when known, agent id) sourced from their presence dirs

#### Scenario: Result extraction is adapter-neutral
- **WHEN** a claude agent finishes a dispatched task
- **THEN** `orch result <target>` prints the final assistant text from that agent's `result.json`

#### Scenario: A presence-only agent is labeled by its real adapter
- **WHEN** a codex agent has written presence but is not enumerated by the backend, and `orch status --json` is invoked
- **THEN** its `AGENT` column reads `codex` (from the presence/spawn record), not `pi`

#### Scenario: Session fallbacks come from the resolved adapter
- **WHEN** an agent whose adapter declares `sessionTail` has a native session/log but no live presence writer, and `orch status` is invoked
- **THEN** its state and last text are produced by that adapter's session parsing, and an adapter without `sessionTail` instead shows the backend-reported status

#### Scenario: Presence identity uses orch env
- **WHEN** an agent adapter starts under any supported backend
- **THEN** it reads its opaque identity from the orch-provided environment key and never reads `HERDR_PANE_ID` or another plexer-specific identity variable

### Requirement: Declared capabilities with explicit degraded modes
Each adapter SHALL declare its capabilities (steer mechanism, blocking ask support, model switching, session tail). A command relying on an unsupported capability SHALL either fall back with a printed warning (e.g. steer via pane keystrokes when no inbox exists) or fail fast with exit code 1 and an actionable message — never silently no-op.

#### Scenario: Steer falls back with a warning
- **WHEN** the user runs `orch steer <claude-target> "focus on tests"` and the claude adapter declares steer capability `keys`
- **THEN** the text is delivered via pane keystrokes and a warning names the degraded mechanism

#### Scenario: Unsupported model switch fails fast
- **WHEN** the user runs `orch model <codex-target> openai/gpt-x` and the codex adapter does not support model switching
- **THEN** orch exits 1 with a message stating the codex adapter cannot switch models

### Requirement: Claude Code adapter
orch SHALL ship a Claude Code adapter whose shim (hook scripts installed by `orch setup`) writes presence protocol files for session start, state transitions, final results, and blocked/notification states. The shim SHALL be installable and removable without affecting the user's other Claude Code hooks.

#### Scenario: Claude agent lifecycle is visible
- **WHEN** a claude agent spawned by orch starts working on a prompt and later finishes
- **THEN** its `status.json` shows `working` during the run and `done` after, and `result.json` contains the final text

#### Scenario: Setup installs the shim additively
- **WHEN** the user runs `orch setup` with an existing Claude Code hooks configuration
- **THEN** orch's hooks are merged in without removing or overwriting unrelated user hooks

### Requirement: pi adapter preserves existing behavior
The pi adapter SHALL retain current behavior exactly: `orchestrator-bridge.ts` as the presence writer, inbox steering, `orch_ask` blocking questions, model/thinking switching via inbox commands, and result extraction — with no changes required to existing user workflows.

#### Scenario: Existing pi flow unchanged
- **WHEN** a user upgrades orch and runs their existing `orch spawn 3 --tab work` + `orch dispatch pi-1 "task"` flow with no config file
- **THEN** behavior is identical to pre-adapter orch (pi launched, worker header applied, presence-based status)

## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Agent identity is an opaque orch key
The orch spawn surface SHALL mint or receive an opaque identity key for each agent, pass it to the adapter through a documented orch-provided environment variable, and require the adapter to use that key for presence paths. The key MUST NOT be a plexer-specific value such as `HERDR_PANE_ID`, and agent adapters MUST NOT reference herdr or tmux types, variables, or commands.

#### Scenario: Adapter runs on multiple backends
- **WHEN** the user spawns the same agent adapter on herdr, tmux, and headless backends
- **THEN** each process receives the same kind of orch-provided opaque identity environment key and the adapter code and behavior do not reference the concrete backend

#### Scenario: Missing opaque key fails safely
- **WHEN** an agent adapter starts without the orch-provided identity environment key
- **THEN** it exits non-zero or writes a clear error state instead of deriving identity from `HERDR_PANE_ID` or another plexer variable
